Hello/Hah, you must have something wrong with your eyes. I haven’t been pretty for a while now. At least not after my little monsters were born and my husband hit the road./You’re being very kind, thank you. What’s your story by the way, going to a party tonight?/Is that so? I guess that’s why you started talking with me then, isn’t it?/I’m sure *laughs* Well tell me about this incredible opportunity then. What’s it all about?/That sounds incredible! The environment has always been close to my heart, but it’s difficult to find companies to invest in, that wouldn’t be all about destroying it./It’s so true./You know what, I have a good feeling about you. How can I get in? I have some savings that I’ve meant to invest for some time now./Great! I’m so happy to have met you!
Hey there, pretty lady! How are you tonight?/Oh but I have to disagree. I think you could maybe be a bit more proud about yourself./Actually I’m looking for people to join an incredible once-in-a-lifetime business venture./Oh no, that wasn’t the reason. I just wanted to talk to a beautiful woman like yourself./Well since you asked, it’s quite incredible, really. It’s a new company that specialises in.. innovative environmental practices. Yes, that’s it. And they are very.. Innovative in it!/It’s sad but true. Very few people care about anything else than their profit. We only have this one planet, and still we keep destroying it. It really is heartbreaking./Us, however, we’re among those few who care. That’s why we founded this investment club; to provide a responsible alternative. I believe Mother Earth deserves it!/Here’s my card. Call this number on monday, and we’ll set up a meeting./The pleasure is all mine, I can assure.
