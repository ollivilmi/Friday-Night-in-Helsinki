Haha, I knew you’d find him if you look hard enough/You’ll remember, don’t worry. Besides, these people are pissed drunk anyway. They won’t even notice if we suck/Whenever you’re ready, just talk to Jartsa and we’ll get started. If you still need to do something before we play, do it now. We’re gonna play at least for an hour.
Look what I found from the gutter!/By the way, what are we going to play? It’s been awhile since we played together, I’m not sure if I remember all the songs./Well, that’s comforting. So, when do we start?/All right, I’ll talk to Jartsa when I’m ready.
