Hey man, do you know when the train is coming?/Teddy, you old shitbag! Sure as hell didn’t expect to see you tonight! How are you?/You just walked in, and now we’re having a gig! I thought the business world would’ve changed you, but I’m happy to see the old Teddy is still there! Let’s do it then!/Awesome! I have to fetch my bass from home, so see you at the Thirsty Conductor then!
Jartsa, I can’t believe I actually found you!/I’m good, how ‘bout you? Listen, I just met with Hippi-Heikki, and we got a crazy idea. There’s an open mic at the Thirsty Conductor tonight, and we’re gonna rock it there like in the old days! Are you in? /Great! We’re having the gig in a few hours, so get your gear and let’s go!/See you there!
