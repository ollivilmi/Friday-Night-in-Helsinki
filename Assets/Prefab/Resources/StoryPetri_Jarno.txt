Well, I lost my job, wife and kids, but at least I have booze I guess./I was stuck in a dead end job that I absolutely could care less about and I had had enough. Turns out the only reason I was still married was money./Could you pass me a cigarette?/I'm just contemplating to end it all... I still have money, but at this rate not for long./I've always dreamt of owning my own farm and taking care of animals, away from this dirty city./Really? Are you sure?/I suppose I'll give it a shot, since there is nothing to lose.
Huh... That sucks. What happened?/Life can be pretty hard sometimes man... But you could still make it. Is there anything I could do to help?/Give tobacco./Wake up man. You can still turn your life around. You said you were unhappy with your job. What would you like to do?/Well, that's not really my expertise... But I know one guy./Stop drinking. Give me all your booze. Get in touch with my friend Jarkko in Kontula./I wish you the best, hopefully you can sort your life out.
