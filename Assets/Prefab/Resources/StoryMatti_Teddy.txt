I was born in Kuopio but I moved here because of my job./I'm pretty sure we work in the same company?/I don't think we've had the pleasure of talking before, but we've probably seen each other./I've been training new phone salesmen. It's incredibly stressful./Could you take this phone to my underling if you happen to meet?
Yep. You don't seem like a local./I knew it. I know some people from Kuopio./Ahh yes, do I know you?/Ahh... What are you up to?/I know, they really are all idiots./Sure thing. See you around.
