Well, I lost my job, wife and kids, but at least I have booze I guess./You beat me to the punch. Yep, seems like the only thing women care about is money./I'm all out... Could you pass me one?/I'm just contemplating to end it all... I still have money, but at this rate not for long./I guess you're right, but at the moment I wish I could just bash some skulls in./Damn, I really didn't expect to get this kind of support from a stranger./I think I shouldn't be here right now. You're right, take my beer, I shouldn't be drinking right now.
Haha, me too man, me too. Did you quit your job?/That's the way the world works. Now before you get any more emotional let's go for a smoke./Give tobacco./Wake up man. That's what absolutely everyone says. It's gonna take a week and you'll be fine./Maybe you should. Perhaps go to the gym?/Neither did I. Why are we wasting time talking and not drinking?/What? I didn't mean that.
