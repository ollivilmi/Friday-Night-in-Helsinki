Uhh, are you talking to me?/Please just leave me alone./Jumalauta you are insistent. If you give me a beer I'll tell you./I was born in Kuopio but I moved here because of my job./Unlike you, I actually pay my taxes and give something back to the society./Thanks for the beer I guess. I've seen you before playing guitar, if you want you could ask my friend Tommi for a place in his band. Oh and take this old phone, it's from his grandma.
Why yes, yes I am./You don't seem like the rest of the people here./Give beer./Doesn't seem like it was a good decision./I didn't mean to offend. It just seems like you are on the edge./It's a big city. We'll see if I run into him.
