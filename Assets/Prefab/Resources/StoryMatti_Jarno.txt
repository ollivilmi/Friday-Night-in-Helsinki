Uhh, are you talking to me?/Please just leave me alone./Jumalauta you are insistent. If you give me a beer I'll tell you./I was born in Kuopio but I moved here because of my job./Unlike you, I actually pay my taxes and give something back to the society./Thanks for the beer I guess. Can you take this old phone to my friend if you happen to meet?
Why yes, yes I am./You don't seem like the rest of the people here./Give beer./Doesn't seem like it was a good decision./I didn't mean to offend. It just seems like you are on the edge./Sure thing, if we happen to meet.
